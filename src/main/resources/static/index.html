只有夜猫子才能体会到的5件事 
	Top 5 
	Incredible Things Only Night Owls Would Experience  
 	Yes, yes, the early bird gets the early worm, 
	 but a night owl too enjoys a host of benefits. 
	 In fact, most of creative people and some of the greatest men and women ever are night-owls. 
	 Did you know that the US President Barrack Obama himself is a self-admitted night owl?  
 	不错，早期的鸟儿有虫吃，但是夜猫子也有很多好处。实际上，大多有创造力的人和一些伟人都曾是夜猫子。你知道美国总统奥巴马承认自己是夜猫子的事吗？
	  1. Better Creativity 有较好的创造力  Creativity comes alive in the night-time. 
	  There is nobody to disturb you around and when the entire world is sleeping quiet your brain gets the perfect ambience to think in peace. 
	  The moon conveys a unique relaxing electricity, a magic, a pulse which the sun does not offer. 
 	  晚上的时候创造力会更活跃。周围没有人打扰你，当整个世界都因沉睡而变得安静的时候，大脑则有最佳的安静的思考氛围。月亮会传达出一种独特的让人放松的魔力,一种太阳没办法传递出的魔力。
 	   2. No Need of Excessive Caffeine 不需要过多的咖啡因  When you are a night owl, you won’t have to be dependent on an excessive dose of caffeine
 	    to perform at night. It’s because the body clock of night owls are automatically adjusted to stay bright and awake independently 
 	    even in the late hours.  如果你是个夜猫子，你是不需要依赖大量的咖啡来熬过暗夜。这是因为夜猫子的生物钟会自动的调节保持精神的振奋，甚至是深夜的时候也能保持清醒的状态。
  	    3. Better Intelligence 更聪慧  Yes, according to studies, night-owls tend to be more intelligent in compared to early birds. 
    	   是的，据研究显示，夜猫子趋向于比那些早起的人更聪慧。 4. Sound Sleep 酣睡  When you retire to bed in the early hours after staying awake for the entire night, 
       you immediately doze off to sleep. There is no time wasted in counting sheep or turning and tossing on the bed. 
       The night owls experience a very happy sound sleep almost everyday. 当你清醒一个晚上后躺倒床上的最初几个小时，你会马上进入梦乡。不会浪费时间去数羊，
 	      在床上辗转难眠。夜猫子几乎每次睡觉都能睡得很好。 5. Flexible Sleeping Patterns 灵活的睡眠模式  According to research, night owls have the benefit of 
       flexible sleeping patterns and they are better equipped to get their needed sleep at any time of the day. On the contrary, 
       early birds find it difficult to adapt to a change in sleep hours.
